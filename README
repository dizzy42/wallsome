1. run the command line command 'bundle'
2. bundle exec rake db:create
3. bundle exec rake db:migrate
4. create a file config/secrets.yml
5. in config/secrets.yml set secret_token to 30+ crazy string
6. in config/secrets.yml set api_token_encryption_secret to 15+ crazy string
It should now look something like this

:secret_token: 123#$%^
:api_token_encryption_secret: 456&*^

7. New accounts will need to be verified manually in the db, because we aren't sending out the email properly.
or, you could fix the email sending.
8. Figure out what else I forgot :)
